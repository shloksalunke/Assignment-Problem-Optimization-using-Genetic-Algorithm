## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom user input for cost matrix (dynamic size)
- 🧬 Genetic Algorithm implemented from scratch:
  - **Selection**
  - **Crossover**
  - **Mutation**
  - **Fitness Evaluation**
- 📊 Real-time optimization via **Streamlit UI**
- ⚙️ Adjustable GA parameters: population size, generations, mutation rate
- 🔁 Visual feedback on optimized assignments and costs

## 📌 Problem Overview

The **Assignment Problem** is a classical optimization problem where `n` agents are assigned to `n` tasks at minimum total cost.  
We solve this using a **Genetic Algorithm**, inspired by the natural selection process.
